* About
C has always been a language where few automations were developed, mainly due to the mindset of the community. This is a project to automate test case generation for static control flow testing.

* Installation
#+begin_src bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv backendEnv
source cparserEnv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
#pip install pycparser #https://github.com/eliben/pycparser/tree/master
#+end_src

* Execute
We have a sample c file at ~test.c~. You can find more complex examples here [[https://github.com/eliben/pycparser/tree/master/examples][here]]. Check the c_files directory.

Our main.py contains a boilerplate code from the above [[https://github.com/eliben/pycparser/tree/master/examples][link]]. This code converts a c file into a AST json format. You can run it by simply doing ~python3 main.py~.

* TODO
- [ ] Understanding AST : @Rifah @Muktadul
- [ ] Converting JSON to Graph visualization @Jubaeer
- [ ] DFS to find independent paths @Abhijit
